# Release Notes

## Version 0.0.1 (Build 2)

Focused patch release for drawer usability and savings/source clarity.

### Changed in this release

- Drawer navigation now keeps the header and user identity pinned at the top while making the module list scrollable on smaller devices.
- Logout action and app version label are pinned at the bottom of the drawer so they stay visible and accessible.
- Transaction filters bottom sheet is now scrollable so all filter controls remain reachable on smaller real-device viewports.
- FAQ has been updated for the savings bucket system and source-based expenses (Budget vs Savings with bucket/sub-category selection).

### Notes

- This section documents only the incremental changes for build 2.
