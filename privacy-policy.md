# Privacy Policy

**App:** ChillCheck  
**Effective date:** 2026-02-27

## 1. Overview

ChillCheck is a shared household finance app designed for families and trusted members to manage spending, income, savings, vehicles, reports, and zakat data within shared spaces.

## 2. Information We Collect

We process account data (such as name, email, and authentication identifiers), finance ledger data (transactions, categories, notes, reports), space membership data, and feature data you enter (such as vehicle logs and gold holdings).

## 3. How We Use Information

Data is used to provide core app functionality, synchronize records between space members, calculate summaries and reports, support zakat and gold-price features, secure accounts, and improve reliability and performance.

## 4. Data Sharing

Your finance records are visible to members of the same space according to app permissions. We do not sell personal data. Third-party service providers (for example Firebase infrastructure and external pricing/conversion APIs) may process limited technical data as required to deliver features.

## 5. Storage and Security

ChillCheck uses Firebase services and security rules to restrict access to authorized space members. We apply reasonable technical safeguards, but no online system can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure.

## 6. Retention and Deletion

Financial records may be soft-deleted and preserved for history and audit consistency. Locally saved PDF reports remain on your device until you delete them.

## 7. Your Choices

You can manage profile details, leave spaces, delete local reports, and stop using the app at any time. Space owners may manage membership and access control for their spaces.

## 8. Children

ChillCheck is not intended for unsupervised use by children. Please use parental or guardian supervision where required by local law.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updated versions become effective when published in the app or this repository.
