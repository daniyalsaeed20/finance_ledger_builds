## About The App

ChillCheck is a shared finance manager for families and trusted members.

It helps users track shared expenses, savings, and zakat in one space, with real-time sync across members and a simple, calm interface so everyone stays clear on where money goes every month.

### What ChillCheck does

- Auth flow: login, register, verify, and persistent sessions
- Space-based collaboration: create, join, switch, and manage shared spaces
- Daily finance tracking: expenses, income, split expense support, and history visibility
- Savings buckets: bucket balances, entry history, deposit/withdraw flows
- Zakat and gold tools: holdings tracking and due-date-based calculation support
- Reports and exports: monthly snapshots with PDF save/share support
- Vehicle logs: maintenance-focused cost and record tracking
- Utilities and support: currency converter, gold prices, FAQ, and feedback

### Core app flow

1. Sign in (`login/register/verify`)
2. Select a space
3. Use main dashboard tabs (`Home`, `Transactions`, `Reports`, `Vehicles`)
4. Access additional modules from drawer (`Spaces`, `Zakat`, `Saved reports`, `Currency converter`, `Gold prices`, `About/Options`, `Feedback`)
